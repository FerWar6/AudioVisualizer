# AudioVisualizer
a processing program I made to visualize music

You can skip around in the song, see what time is left in the song, change the volume of the song and even play and add your own music!
If you want to add your own music, go into the songs menu, click the icon on the bottem right of the menu (it looks like a music note with a +) and select a folder with your own music inside.

How to use:
Clone the repository.
Open AudioVisualizer1.pde using processing.
Go to Tools/Manage Tools/Libraries.
Download the sound library from The Processing Foundation.
Run the project and play some music!
